==== HOMEWORK 2 ====
The code for this project was compiled and successfully ran using Spark v. 3.0.1 and Hadoop v. 2.7 on Windows.

Project Dependencies: pyspark, sys, datetime, re

To run this code:

1. Install and setup PySpark. If using a virtual environment, make sure that you have the pyspark library installed.

2. If using an IDE (such as PyCharm), set \python\lib\py4-0.10.9-src.zip and \python\lib\pyspark.zip from your pyspark installation folder as content roots for your project.

3. Set command line arguments and run.

- For popular_mentions.py, the first command line argument should be used to set your input file (ex. "D:/spark/workspace/input/training_set_tweets.txt") and the second command line argument should be used to set your output folder (ex. "D:/spark/workspace/output/").

- For most_tweeted_users.py, the first command line argument should be set to the tweets file, and the second command line argument should be set to the users file. The third command line argument should be used to set your output folder.

- If you try to run the project without setting the proper command line arguments, the program will print a warning message to the terminal.
